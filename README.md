Climate change refers to long-term alterations in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions over decades or longer. It is driven by natural processes and human activities, with the latter playing a significant role in the current global climate crisis.

#### **Causes**:  
1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) releases carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O) into the atmosphere, trapping heat.  
2. **Deforestation**: Cutting down forests reduces the planet’s ability to absorb CO₂, increasing atmospheric carbon levels.  
3. **Industrial Activities**: Factories release pollutants and greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming.  
4. **Agriculture**: Livestock farming produces methane, while fertilizers release nitrous oxide.  
5. **Natural Factors**: Volcanic eruptions and solar radiation also affect climate, but their impact is relatively minor compared to human activities.

#### **Effects**:  
1. **Rising Temperatures**: Global temperatures are increasing, leading to heatwaves and longer, hotter summers.  
2. **Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels**: Polar ice caps and glaciers are melting, causing sea levels to rise, threatening coastal areas with flooding.  
3. **Extreme Weather Events**: More frequent hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires.  
4. **Impact on Biodiversity**: Species face habitat loss and extinction due to changing climate conditions.  
5. **Human Health Risks**: Increased heat-related illnesses, spread of diseases, and food and water insecurity.

#### **Solutions and Mitigation**:

### (ii) **Acid Rain**  

#### **Definition**:  
Acid rain refers to any form of precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, fog) that contains acidic components such as sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and nitric acid (HNO₃). It forms when sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) released into the atmosphere react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals.

#### **Causes**:  
1. **Industrial Emissions**: Factories and power plants burning fossil fuels emit large amounts of SO₂ and NOₓ.  
2. **Vehicle Exhaust**: Cars and trucks release NOₓ, contributing to acid formation.  
3. **Natural Sources**: Volcanic eruptions and lightning can also produce SO₂ and NOₓ, though human activities are the primary source.

#### **Chemical Reactions**:  
SO₂ and NOₓ react with water vapor and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form sulfuric and nitric acids, which mix with rainwater to fall as acid rain.

#### **Effects**:  
1. **Environmental Damage**:  
   - **Soil**: Acid rain leaches essential nutrients from the soil, affecting plant growth.  
   - **Water Bodies**: Makes lakes and rivers acidic, harming aquatic life such as fish and amphibians.  
   - **Forests**: Damages leaves and weakens trees, making them more vulnerable to diseases and harsh weather.  

2. **Impact on Human Structures**:  
   - **Buildings and Monuments**: Erodes structures made of limestone, marble, and concrete. Iconic monuments like the Taj Mahal have suffered from acid rain damage.

3. **Health Hazards**:  
   - **Respiratory Issues**: Inhalation of SO₂ and NOₓ can cause or worsen respiratory conditions like asthma and bronchitis.  
   - **Contaminated Water**: Acidified water can carry heavy metals, posing risks to human health.

#### **Prevention and Control**:  
1. **Reducing Emissions**:  
   - Using cleaner energy sources like natural gas, solar, and wind.  
   - Installing scrubbers in power plants to remove pollutants from emissions.  
2. **Catalytic Converters**: Vehicles can be fitted with devices to reduce NOₓ emissions.  
3. **Legislation**:  
   - Governments enforce air quality standards and regulate emissions.  
   - The **Clean Air Act** in the United States and similar regulations globally have reduced acid rain incidence.  
4. **Public Awareness**: Educating people about energy conservation and pollution control helps reduce acid rain.
